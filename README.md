# LSA: Linguistic Semantic Analysis
This area contains files in support of Linguistic Semantic Analysis.
There are 
- 3 pairs of csv files which contain stories collected from Media Cloud ( https://tools.mediacloud.org/ ) by Sam Gassel, and categorized as "left" or "right"
- A python script that reads the CSV files and retrieves the text, generating a large xml-ish file with entries for each retrieved text and it's metadata
- the output from the first run of this script
