# LSA: Linguistic Semantic Analysis

This area contains files in support of Linguistic Semantic Analysis.
There are :

- 3 pairs of csv files which contain stories collected from Media
  Cloud ( https://tools.mediacloud.org/ ) by Sam Gassel, and
  categorized as "left" or "right", stored in the data folder

- The output from the first run of this script, also in data

- Python scripts that read the CSV files and retrieve the text,
  generating a large xml-ish file with entries for each retrieved text
  and it's metadata.
